There are 2 types of codes in here :
<ol>
<li>Those that use the header file "SimpleLinkedList.h" , which has a class implementation of Node and list defined by me. The classes have some features defined from earlier. For quick implementation stuff.</li>
<li>Those that use the header file "SimpleNode.h", which has only a simple node with printAll() method defined. For core understanding. Files using these have "<strong>__nodal.cpp</strong>" as their suffix.</li>
</ol>
